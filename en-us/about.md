## About Me

16 years old | High School Sophomore | Amateur Developer | New College Entrance Exam (Gaokao) with Chinese, English, Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Geography

Unlocked Regions (roughly in chronological order):

- **Henan Province** Pingdingshan City | Yuzhou City | Zhengzhou City
- **Shandong Province** Qingdao City | Rizhao City

Dreams are always there, so when will MIT, YALE, Princeton, PKU, THU, USTC, CQU, SWU, etc. send me an acceptance letter?

Appearing in every corner of the Internet.

Uploading videos of the monitoring of Hechuan Middle School's dining area, entertainment area, and sleeping area.

Peace & Love, long live peace. Hope for a world without gunpowder.

Typesetting OCD, **must** keep a space between Chinese and English, Arabic numerals, and punctuation. It's uncomfortable to see someone not doing this.

Personality is ~~perhaps~~ more introverted, not good at taking the initiative to talk to people in real life (well, actually not good at it online either).
